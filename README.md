# TTZC0200-Ohjelmoinnin-perusteet
First C++ course's projects.
Tetris is the best project thus far.

[Tetris](https://github.com/Szeretni/TTZC0200-Ohjelmoinnin-perusteet/blob/master/tetris/tetris.cpp)
Tetris-folder includes lots of cpp-files. Tetris.cpp is the current. I took copies of the current work file before adding new features. Therefore, I always had a robust file to revert back to, if needed.
